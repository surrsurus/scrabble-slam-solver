Finds the longest word of a scrabble-slam board

The Philadelphia Free Library Sunday Literacy program uses a number of vocabulary related games to teach children struggling to read. "Scrabble Slam" is a game where scrabble slam cards are laid out onto a table in an orderly fashion, and players will try to make the longest word possible using the cards. The cards each have a front and back face, and can only be used once per word, as in a front and back cannot be present in a word, nor can the same card be used twice. Whoever has the most cards at the end, wins.

This program analyzes a board (randomly generated) and outputs an optimal solution to find the longest word amongst the cards. Obviously, this wouldn't be very fun to play against!
